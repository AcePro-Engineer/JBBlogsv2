 My First Web Application using Reactjs/Django

 This is a simple blog web site that I created using Reactjs/Django. To any experienced python developers that may review this site in the near future, please forgive any strange design choices in this project. I am used to the layered approach I have encountered in the .NET projects I have worked on in the past. The django backend has been modeled following this approach, while also attempting to incorporate pythonic software design principles.
